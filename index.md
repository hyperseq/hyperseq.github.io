HyperSeq is an early-stage startup bringing enterprise-grade hyperconverged infrastructures to genomic data services in the biotech industry.  From private sequencing companies to non-profit genome centers, petabytes of DNA data are being generated each month in fields ranging from human medicine to agricultural genomics.  At HyperSeq, we provide customers with a single software-driven appliance that combines compute, storage, and networking facilities tailored to the intricacies of their genomics data.  As such, we offer optimized DNA storage capacity, reduced cost-per-petabyte for analytical genomic computations, and tight security for mission-critical sequencing data.

# [](#header-1)Note to Investors

## [](#header-2)Market Potential

[Gartner Inc.](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3308017) predicts that the market for hyperconverged integrated systems will reach nearly $5 billion -- or 24% of the overall market for integrated systems -- by 2019.

## [](#header-2)Value Proposition

HyperSeq is poised to capitalize on the hyperconvergence market, being the first biotech company to offer specialized hyperconverged infrastructures tailored to genomic data services of DNA sequencing enterprises.

## [](#header-2)Data Costs

Relative to public cloud platforms, hyperconvergence infrastructures offer 27-55% lower costs, providing minimum allocation of run-rate resources, thereby saving you money (source: "Is a Hyperconverged Infrastructure Cost-Competitive with the Cloud?," Evaluator Group, June 2017).

## [](#header-2)Data Security

In contrast to public cloud infrastructures, HyperSeq offers on-premises IT infrastructure and the deployment of internal "private cloud" infrastructures.  In other words, only you control and have access to your data at all times. 

## [](#header-2)Data Scalability

Analyzing a single human genome takes about 300 GB of data-handling capacity.  HyperSeq gives you the ability to start small and increase the scalability of your platform by adding extra nodes as needed by your enterprise.  You can build as you grow. 

## [](#header-2)Data Integrity

HyperSeq offers end-to-end genomic data backup and automated disaster recovery tools.  In other words, you will never lose your data.
